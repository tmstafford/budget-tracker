# Budget Tracker PWA

## Description
Budget Tracker is an easy way for users to track their money as they can track each expense or deposit and note the transaction description. This application is a PWA, allowing for full offline access and functionality. Users have access to their important financial information at any time, with or without a connection. When a user enters a new transaction offline, the total will be updated when they are back online and will be notified. 

The application was built with an express.js server with IndexedDB for offline functionality, as well as a service worker and web manifest, and MongoDB as its database. The application is deployed to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas.

Application is [deployed here](https://vast-stream-89632.herokuapp.com/).
